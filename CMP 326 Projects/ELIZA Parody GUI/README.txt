A GUI I developed for my programming class that parodies the popular ELIZA psychotherapist program.

INSTRUCTIONS:
1)Answer displayed question with a single sentence --> 'Psychotherapist' answers back with longest word from sentence displayed as an output. 
2)Press 'Request Log' button and the GUI will display the name of the log. 
  NOTE:Log file is found in the directory of the source code or .jar file
3)You can open the text file through the GUI and read it from the giant Text Area by pressing 'Read Text File' --> Search for 'RequestedLog.txt'
